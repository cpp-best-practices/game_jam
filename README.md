# Jason's C++ Best Practices Game Jam Official Rules

The C++ Best Practices Game Jam is a periodic friendly competition designed to promote the learning of C++ through game creation in an environment that makes it easy to apply Best Practices.

Be sure to read through this entire document. We want you to have fun, and have given you startup projects that help you succeed and apply all of the rules!

Also, it's fine to start playing with the game project template today and familiarize yourself with it.

## Who is Jason and Why Does He Have a Game Jam?

Jason Turner (aka lefticus):

 * Host of [C++ Weekly YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHAlbZQNFU2LgEtiqd2Maw)
 * Co-host of [CppCast](https://cppcast.com)
 * Author of the book "C++ Best Practices" and several C++ related puzzle books available on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/u/jason_turner) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Jason-Turner/e/B0034N9C8G%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share)

At the start of 2022 Jason made it a goal of his channel and Twitter interactions to make C++ "Fun and Accessible." The hope is that this game jam provides a FUN environment for people to learn C++.

## Rules

Games must:
 * use [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI)
 * be created from the [C++ Best Practices/ftxui_template project](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/ftxui_template) via "use this template."
 * compile with no warnings or errors on all pre-configured [actions](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/ftxui_template/actions)
 * have selected a license
 * run with no errors from Address Sanitizer or Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (as configured by default in "developer mode" of the provided template)

## Who Can Participate?

Anyone willing to follow the Code of Conduct. Families and teams are encouraged.

## What Libraries Can I Use?

Anything you want to, as long as it does not violate any other rules. Conan package manager is provided with the template, and it uses some packages already. However, all output must still happen through FTXUI.

## Teams

Teams of any size are allowed. Just be aware that coordinating large teams can be difficult. To meet other people to join into a team, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/tnGs7Jju)



## How Submissions Are Judged

 * Interpretation of Theme
 * Gameplay
 * Creativity
 * Code Quality / Code Readability
 * Fun
 * Testing of Game Code

# Some Hints

 * The template provided gives you the foundation for a turn-based game
 * FTXUI has a canvas: https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI/blob/master/examples/dom/canvas.cpp
 * The "homescreen" example shows how to do live animations / event loop https://arthursonzogni.com/FTXUI/examples/?file=component/homescreen
 * It should be possible to create a normal game loop
 * There are Unicode fonts which might prove to be useful: https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/block-elements/ https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/symbols-for-legacy-computing/
